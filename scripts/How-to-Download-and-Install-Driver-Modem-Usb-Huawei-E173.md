## Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you encounter any problems with your Huawei E173 modem, here are some tips that might help you:

- Make sure your modem is connected properly to your PC using a USB cable. Avoid using a USB hub or extension cable as they might interfere with the signal.
- Make sure your SIM card is inserted correctly into the modem and has enough balance and coverage.
- Make sure you have selected the correct COM port for your modem in your application settings. You can check the COM port number in Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT) category.
- If you have multiple modems connected to your PC, make sure they are not using the same COM port or conflicting with each other.
- If you have installed any other software that might interfere with your modem, such as antivirus, firewall, or VPN, try disabling them temporarily and see if that solves the problem.
- If none of the above tips work, you might want to contact Huawei support[^3^] or visit their online forum[^4^] for more help.
